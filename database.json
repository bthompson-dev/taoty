Just 21 years old, from Hammersmith, London, she has achieved commercial and critical success with her debut album Collapsed in Sunbeams, winning the Mercury Prize and now securing a nomination for the prestigious Thompson award. With gentle, laid-back pop melodies, soulful vocals and jazzy rhythms, this is an album that soothes the listener, even while it addresses darker themes of depression, prejudice, anxiety and trauma. Parks’ lyrics are intimate and conversational, painting complex emotional scenes with delicately chosen words that still sound as though they're directed to a close friend. Collapsed in Sunbeams opens the curtains and lets the light in, offering empathy and support for those who may be struggling.","year":2021,"release_date":{"$date":"2021-01-29"},"winner":false,"images":["./img/arlo_parks-small.jpg","./img/arlo_parks-medium.jpg","./img/arlo_parks-large.jpg"]},{"title":"For the First Time","artist":"Black Country, New Road","genre":"Post-rock / Experimental Rock","primary_genres":["Rock"],"nationality":"UK","description":"For the First Time is the debut album of Black Country, New Road – a seven-piece band who are part of a new wave of fearlessly experimental groups from South London. Combining the sounds of post-punk, art rock, free jazz and Jewish Klezmer music, they build atmospheric, carnivalesque soundscapes that grow to glorious cacophony. Above it all, frontman Isaac Wood’s sardonic, snarling vocals move from manic arrogance to wounded introspection, pulling together strange narratives that match the bristling tension of the music.","year":2021,"release_date":{"$date":"2021-02-05"},"winner":false,"images":["./img/black_country-small.jpg","./img/black_country-medium.jpg","./img/black_country-large.jpg"]},{"title":"Promises","artist":"Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra","genre":"Post-minimalism / Third Stream","primary_genres":["Classical","Jazz"],"nationality":"UK / USA","description":"Promises is a collaboration between Sam Shepherd (aka Floating Points), a Manchester-based electronic musician, and Pharoah Sanders, the legendary American free jazz saxophonist who is now over 80 years old. Built around a simple, looping 7-note motif that persists through the nine movements of the piece, the music seems to breathe and evolve, erupting into orchestral surges only to soften and retreat into hushed electronic tones and textures.

A cinematically crafted narrative of growth and self-definition, it marks a triumphant evolution. She’s built out her sound, incorporating an eclectic mix of R&B, soul, Afrobeat and grime, topped with huge orchestral flourishes, a gospel choir, and even a narrator (voiced by The Crown’s Emma Corrin). Over the course of the album, she explores the contradiction between seeking the validation of commercial success while remaining a private person who struggles inwardly with self-doubt.

The decadence of this character sets the tone for the album, which sprawls luxuriously, pushing at the boundaries of his music. Rich, sun-soaked production, built on samples of synthpop, soul, reggae and jazz, is juxtaposed with a return to the heavier, harsher rap of his early material. This variety gives him the freedom to interrogate the messy extremes of his experience, from wild excesses to raw, tender feeling.

Her resultant fear and sorrow is poured into the album Ignorance, which finds a way to process her feelings of helplessness as a kind of grief or heartbreak.

Here, they are expansive in their scope, surveying the history he has lived through and the mythology that surrounds him with a wry eloquence.

Over time, her music has grown wilder, discarding conventional song structures for an uncompromising, disruptive form that is completely her own. This experimental freedom also signals her central theme: finding freedom from male oppression.
