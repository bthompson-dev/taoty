    "description": "Arlo Parks has had quite a start to her music career. Just 21 years old, from Hammersmith, London, she has achieved commercial and critical success with her debut album Collapsed in Sunbeams, winning the Mercury Prize and now securing a nomination for the prestigious Thompson award. With gentle, laid-back pop melodies, soulful vocals and jazzy rhythms, this is an album that soothes the listener, even while it addresses darker themes of depression, prejudice, anxiety and trauma. Parks’ lyrics are intimate and conversational, painting complex emotional scenes with delicately chosen words that still sound as though they're directed to a close friend. Collapsed in Sunbeams opens the curtains and lets the light in, offering empathy and support for those who may be struggling.",

Combining the sounds of post-punk, art rock, free jazz and Jewish Klezmer music, they build atmospheric, carnivalesque soundscapes that grow to glorious cacophony. Above it all, frontman Isaac Wood’s sardonic, snarling vocals move from manic arrogance to wounded introspection, pulling together strange narratives that match the bristling tension of the music.",

Built around a simple, looping 7-note motif that persists through the nine movements of the piece, the music seems to breathe and evolve, erupting into orchestral surges only to soften and retreat into hushed electronic tones and textures. Sanders’ saxophone is fluid, powerful and graceful, feeling its way through the ambient universe around him. A subtle, transcendent exploration of sound.",

She’s built out her sound, incorporating an eclectic mix of R&B, soul, Afrobeat and grime, topped with huge orchestral flourishes, a gospel choir, and even a narrator (voiced by The Crown’s Emma Corrin). Over the course of the album, she explores the contradiction between seeking the validation of commercial success while remaining a private person who struggles inwardly with self-doubt. An introvert with one of the most self-affirming, colourful and ambitious albums of the year.",

The decadence of this character sets the tone for the album, which sprawls luxuriously, pushing at the boundaries of his music. Rich, sun-soaked production, built on samples of synthpop, soul, reggae and jazz, is juxtaposed with a return to the heavier, harsher rap of his early material. This variety gives him the freedom to interrogate the messy extremes of his experience, from wild excesses to raw, tender feeling. Tyler’s talent for reinvention makes this a record worth losing yourself in.",

Her resultant fear and sorrow is poured into the album Ignorance, which finds a way to process her feelings of helplessness as a kind of grief or heartbreak. Backed by lush, delicate folk-pop arrangements, she sings of small moments of epiphany and realisation, acknowledging the emotional weight of humanity’s ongoing breakup with nature.",

Here, they are expansive in their scope, surveying the history he has lived through and the mythology that surrounds him with a wry eloquence. The references that he weaves throughout, to music, literature, and art, strengthen his connection with the past; the music becomes an elegy for the culture Dylan has helped to shape.",

Their work is heavily focused on black issues, and they were clearly galvanised by the Black Lives Matter protests this year, releasing two albums in the space of 12 weeks. Both felt like direct responses to the global outpouring of feeling and frustration, but with markedly different approaches. While the first album was characterised by anger and sorrow, the sequel, Untitled (Rise), emphasises hope, renewal and empowerment. Blending the sounds of R&B, soul, disco and Afrobeat, Sault soundtrack the defiant call for liberation and equality from black voices around the world.",

He and Kanye have been collaborators since the start of Kid Cudi’s musical career – working on a number of Kanye’s biggest albums, including his magnum opus from 2010, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which you will all remember from the nominations that year! Concerns over Kanye’s political views and unstable mental health hover over all the music he has put out lately, but do not seem to have hampered his creative energy…",

    "description": "The veterans of this year’s selection, Low, from Duluth, Minnesota, have been making music together since 1993. Although never quite a household name, they rose to prominence in the 90s, known for their ‘slowcore’, minimalist rock and gigs where they played so quietly audiences would sit on the ground to listen. On Double Negative, their 12th album, this sound is invaded and distorted. Eerie static cuts up their harmonies, electronic reverb and reversal overpowering the guitars to leave an alien wall of noise. Apocalyptic, otherworldly, but beautiful.",

Each track on Sons of Kemet’s third album is dedicated to an influential black woman from history, from Hutchings’ own great grandmother to political activists and leaders such as Harriet Tubman and Nanny of the Maroons. By crowning this new lineage of alternative ‘Queens’, Sons of Kemet celebrate female black identity at the same time as challenging the legacy of the British monarchy, and exposing the lizard-like qualities of dear old Elizabeth.",

Listening to his pained lyrics of heartbreak, futility and self-destruction on the album, it’s not hard to see what might have caused him to step away. Although the band have now started touring without him, and with a new set of songs, Ants From Up There remains a cathartic work of art that is triumphant, but heart-breaking in its vulnerability.",

One of his most ambitious and confessional works, his target here is his own psyche. Over eighteen tracks, he recounts his own journey through therapy, exposing ugly truths about his past: mistakes, prejudices and generational scars he still carries. Like the mental processes he is trying to understand, the sound of the music is restless and at times jarring, jumping from trap beats to stark piano and choral arrangements. Vocal snippets scattered throughout suggest those most strongly influencing Kendrick: the German self-help author Eckhart Tolle, Kendrick’s long-term partner Whitney, and his young children (who feature on the album cover). His newfound tenderness and introspection is driven by the desire to heal himself for their sake – to become a father who can save them from trauma and pain. On Mr. Morale, Kendrick’s versatility as a rapper is matched by his daring in opening himself up to the world.",

    "description": "Brittney Parks (a.k.a. Sudan Archives) is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Cincinnati, Ohio. Originally known for her R&B compositions built up with a violin and a loop pedal, on Natural Brown Prom Queen she expands her sound to experiment with a dizzying range of genres. Telling personal stories of relationships, femininity and race, she weaves together myriad flavours of R&B, hip-hop, jazz, psychedelia, pop and more in a shimmering collage of self-expression. Anything but average.",

    "description": "I Love You Jennifer B is the debut album from Jockstrap, a musical duo consisting of Georgia Ellery and Taylor Skye, who met at Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London. Impressively, it’s Georgia’s second entry on the TAOTYs this year, as she also plays violin for Black Country, New Road. It’s another record that juggles with genre, ripping up the listener’s expectations with gleeful juxtapositions of sound and style. It’s impossible to tell what will come next, as moments of sweetness and beauty are punctured by distortion, dubstep beats, glitch pop sounds or dramatic strings and percussion. The effect is unsettling and futuristic, but also weirdly beautiful.",

    "nationality": "UK",
    "description": "She’s back. It’s been a busy year for Little Simz, with the success of Sometimes I Might Be Introvert taking her to new heights, including awards at the Brits and the Mercury Prize. At the same time, she has continued to struggle with the music industry as an independent artist. Earlier this year, she parted company with her manager of seven years, and was then forced to cancel her planned US tour due to financial uncertainty and stress. Her disillusionment and anger towards the industry burns fiercely on NO THANK YOU. She lays into the ‘suits’ who have taken advantage of her, dissects the motives behind those pushing her to ever greater commercial success, and questions what she’s doing it all for. Longtime collaborator Inflo (known for his work as part of Sault) returns as producer, crafting lush arrangements of gospel choir and strings that not only compliment Simz’ flow but frequently rise above it as a centrepiece of the record. With her 3rd consecutive album in the TAOTYs, Little Simz continues to establish herself as a pivotal voice in the UK rap scene – one who won’t hold back.",
